# zkLean
zkLean is a domain specific language (DSL) in Lean for specifying zero-knowledge statements


# Development

To compile the zkLean library do:
```
lake build
```

The `Main.lean` file contains some examples of using the library.

A more comprehensive use of the library is done by the companion project forautomatic extraction
of Jolt circuits into circuits specified with ZkLean (repo available soon).
